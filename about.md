I treat this blog as a mix between a zettlekasten and a digital garden. Some entries are quick, and discuss areas I'm no expert in, others are long running or revisited frequently. No opinions represent that of my future employer's. 

I am using the [Klis√©](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) theme, thank you to [piharpi](https://github.com/piharpi) for open sourcing it.
