title: Thoughts on Integrity
---

Two weeks I unexpectedly got to the top of hackernews because of events that transpired three weeks ago: I whistleblew on foreign contractor(s) using others' identities to get contracts. I knew about all this because I was invited on board by this foreign contractor as a senior engineer to handle client communications. I quickly dropped when I realized how they were getting these contracts.

But before I stopped communications with them, they sent me a meeting document, **providing me the information of an engineer I should pretend as** and the meeting link. I forwarded this document to the real Connor Tumbleson, and he actually joined the meeting between fake Connor and the client.

That was nothing less than a spectacle, and here's Connor blog on it (which is also the post that got to the top of hackernews). But since Connor has already done an incredible job covering the events, I will focus on another subject: Integrity.

A lot of folks in the comment section of hackernews were saying that I have integrity, and they respect the choice I've taken. I genuinely appreciate these sentiments, but I honestly do not believe I deserve such high of a praise.

And here's the reason I'm putting myself down: Good qualities, like honor, courage, endurance, are too easily earned nowadays, but a higher threshold is necessary. I believe a society where every child is handed participation awards, where obese folks are deemed courageous by showing their bodies online is an environment exhibiting performative, and not true, kindness. And on the last point, the medal of courage should only be designated towards those that endured immense pain and suffering on situations out of their control, or put their livelihoods on the line: Survivors of abuse, true victims, fireman, etc.

So we must raise the bar, not because we are trying to put each other down. But precisely because in the long run, this creates more honorable men and women.
