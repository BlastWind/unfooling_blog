title: Move In Thoughts

This week I moved down to college into a new apartment.

- Don't drive in the left lane if you're not prepared to go fast.

- Second order thinking is useful everywhere
  - I see traffic on map app and the app suggests an alternate, time-saving route -\> I impulsively want to take the suggestion -\> But, map app is only able to track traffic due to phones, and the map app will suggest the same route to everyone, I instead choose to stay in traffic. Result: the alternate road was soon blocked and the traffic was not as bad due to folks trying to escape it.
