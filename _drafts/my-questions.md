I keep a list of curious questions that I'm in no hurry in answering. If you happen to know the answer, maybe, kindly ping me at my email (andrewchen14250@gmail.com)!



- What's a not-so-hot right now field that you're in, in which you are certain will direct the future? 

Perhaps, a decade and a half ago, becoming a financial analyst, doctor, or lawyer is still the coolest thing on the block. At that time, majoring in computer science (obviously, I didn't live at that time, but this is testimony from the YCombinator podcast guys) is a thing people did because they really liked computer science. Especially, that's when the dot com bubble bursted â€” What's will be the computer science field 15 years from now?
