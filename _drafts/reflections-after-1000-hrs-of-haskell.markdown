I'm going to try and

- Haskell is harder and less complex than the likes of Typescript, Python, C++, etc. I regard "complex" as something that 1) do not conform to common patterns and 2) beginners can actually understand if they painstakingly trace through. I regard "hard" as something whose learning curve is so high you can't understand it without additional material, but once learned, it stays in your arsenal.
