title: Perfect learning paths.
---

A perfect learning path does not aim only at knowledge, but also, to shape the adventurer a better learner. My mother confirmed that the most useful thing she got out of her MBA was how to research, and not necessarily business management skills.

So, there are tradeoffs in learning content. A linear algebra course could come in 3 distinct flavors: Abstraction, computation, or intuition heavy. An abstraction heavy class acquaints students closely with the jargon of the field (Jordan canonical form, unitary similarities, hermitian); A computation class gives students motivation of the concepts (Ah, if I find the LU decomposition first I can accelerate this algorithm by 50%); An intuition heavy class provides geometric intuitions and long term understanding with the draw of less knowledge (Ah, a matrix is really just a transformation function, and eigenvectors of a matrix are vectors that are scaled but not rotated when undergoing this transformation).

For Computer Science, I hypothesize the ideal learning path should compose of all 3 aforementioned flavors: Abstraction, intuition, and computation. In the post, I first contemplate what happens when a student is missing out from the flavor. Then, I theorize how much of each flavor , with only reference to my own learning paths.
