Ongoing list:
- ArgParser everywhere instead of ever `sys.argv`-ing, the latter just adds to cognitive load.
- Always check argument validity. Not just runtime type check â€” if `args.output_dir` specifies the output directory, check if it exists **before** running meaningful code. 
- GPT4 writes huggingface code pretty well.
- Provide a `--dummy` flag for your long-running scripts. When `dummy`, those scripts load some shorter, hard-coded value to test your scripts. Of course, test cases are often better if you have the resources.
- Compile reproducible parts of your project to a single `.sh` script. Allow for this shell script to also operate under `--dummy`, which in turn invokes all your python scripts with `--dummy`.
