I worked at [ClearBlade](https://www.clearblade.com/) for 15 months, 6 months in UI and the rest in MLOps. I title this article with "opinions", and not "lessons", because lessons are synonymous with facts, but this listing is by no means factual.

- Reading the source code is more responsible and often faster than asking the author, given that you understand the source's architecture. This echoes item 1 in Matt's [reflection](https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming).
- Don't force dumber code in the fear of others not understanding. Example: Paul Graham on [Why Lisp?](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html). Writing hard (but simple) code makes you smarter and inspires code reviewers. Here's a good article on [hard vs easy, complex vs simple](https://rpeszek.github.io/posts/2022-08-30-code-cognitiveload.html).
- If you lack knowledge in an established research area (e.g., database, OS, etc), the best way to catch up is to read a textbook.
- The quality of a software correlates with how much internal information it has on its documentation. Of course, some software must reveal its internals. However, I find myself revealing unnecessary internal information when I am unable to articulate the usages.
- 9 pregnant women can't give birth to a baby in one month (from [The Mythical Man Month](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Mythical_Man-Month)). I now understand how true this. Conversely, project managers must decide on this balance, and that's why tech PMs should have tech backgrounds. 
- And the most important tech opinion: Tech is created by people and for people, so **people \> tech**. Software engineering sits in between computer science and social science. My experience at ClearBlade was enjoyable: People at my work were nice and acknowledged each other's doing, my CTO reminded me to take vacations, and the list goes on.
